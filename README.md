## 👨‍💻 About the Project  
During my internship, I first built this project using **Vanilla JavaScript** and **CSS3**, focusing on mastering responsive design and layout structure from scratch.  

Now, I'm rebuilding it using **React** and **Styled Components**, aiming for a more scalable, component-driven architecture. This version will also enhance maintainability and improve styling workflow through CSS-in-JS.
